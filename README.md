# Emotion Discovery and Reasoning its Flip in Conversation (EDiReF)

This repository contains the codebase developed as part of my Master's thesis. It addresses the task of **Emotion Discovery and Reasoning its Flip in Conversation (EDiReF)**, introduced in [SemEval 2024](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/). The goal is to detect emotions in dialogue and reason about how they change across conversational turns.

The solution is based on the **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** technique, incorporating **transformer-based models** for emotion classification and reasoning.

```bash
./run_experiments.sh --datasets MELD,MaSaC --stage 1 --train_bert True
```

üìÅ Project structure:
```
experiment_configs/   # YAML files defining experimental setups 
notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks for interactive training
scripts/              # Python scripts for training and evaluation
results/              # Final performance results (cleaned)
run_experiments.sh    # Main entry point for reproducing experiments
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is functional research code. While the code is well-documented and structured for readability, it is maintained as monolithic notebooks and scripts by design. Modularization is not planned.
